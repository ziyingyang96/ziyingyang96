### Hi there 👋 I am Ziying Yang (杨子影).

🌱 I’m currently a PhD student at [Computational Oncogenomics Group](https://info.baudisgroup.org/), [Department of Molecular Life Sciences](https://www.mls.uzh.ch/en.html), [UZH](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html). Supervisor: [Michael Baudis](https://info.baudisgroup.org/group/Michael-Baudis/#more). 

🤔 My current works are mostly data-driven research of copy number variants (CNV) on cancer genomes, including copy number heterogeneity revealing inconsistency in cancer classification systems, CNV patterns on pan-cancer, and attention mechanism-based methods for uncovering CNV signatures on pan-cancer.

📫 Reach me for collaborations or just general questions [here](ziyyan96@gmail.com).
